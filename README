This project contains an Oracle Package which inserts into a Log table all
fields changed into a table. It includes an example table for test and usage
purposes. The code is based on Zlatko Sirotic's work found in this forum post:
https://community.oracle.com/thread/8380 

This mechanism logs each column change on each register updated for the
selected table.

USAGE:
1- Create the test tables used on the example (file: 'create_test_tables.sql').
2- Create the package and the package body into your Oracle Database (file:
'dynamic_new_old.sql').
3- Create the 3 triggers for your tables(file: 'create_test_triggers.sql').
4- Populate and update data into the table (file: 'test_data.sql').

After running and understanding the example, the mecanism can be updated by
changing the file 'dynamic_new_old.sql' for your purposes. NOTICE that the log
table is not dynamic populated and probably will need changes before usage.

The usage of the mecanism is based on the triggers generated, so it's needed to
create each of them for all the tables to log.
